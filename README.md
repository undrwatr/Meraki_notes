# Meraki_notes
Checks on the Meraki Notes field and reports all of the information for the networks

This program will go through all of the devices in the network and give you the information in the notes field. This is useful if you have been using the notes field for information and need to either clean it up or update it as needed. This was useful to us to clean up all of the information that was there.
